            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>In the world of international football, a vast dataset containing 44,341 results of matches has been compiled, spanning from the very first official match in 1872 up to the year 2023. This dataset encompasses a wide range of tournaments, from the prestigious FIFA World Cup to lesser-known competitions like the FIFI Wild Cup. The dataset focuses exclusively on men’s full international and excludes matches from the Olympic Games or those involving B-teams, U-23 teams, or league select teams. </p>
            <p>The purpose of this story is to delve into this comprehensive dataset and explore three different types of visualizations – table-related, network-related, and geometry-related. By analyzing these visualizations, we aim to uncover valuable insights and patterns that can enhance our understanding of historical trends, team rivalries, geographical patterns, and more. Ultimately, these visualizations contribute to the growth and development of international football, empowering stakeholders to make informed decision and drive the game forward.</p>
